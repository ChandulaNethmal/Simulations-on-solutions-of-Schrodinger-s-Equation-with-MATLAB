# Simulations-on-solutions-of-Schrodinger-s-Equation-with-MATLAB
There are different examples regarding a single particle which is trapped inside different potential distributions in one-dimensional, two-dimensional or threedimensional cases. In each case we will discuss the example by applying Schrodinger’s equation and coming to conclusions about the motion of the particle and probabilities of finding the particle. Also, we simulate results from the Schrodinger’s equation with MATLAB software package using different numerical techniques and inbuilt libraries to plot resulting functions.
