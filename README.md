# Simulations-on-solutions-of-Schrodinger-s-Equation-with-MATLAB

Since some behaviors of electromagnetic waves and atomic particles could not be understood
within the scope of classical laws of physics, scientists started to do researches and experiments
to build up a revised formulation which can explain reasons to this indeterministic behavior.
Specially the wave-particle duality of electrons came up as results of several scientific
experiments such as electron deflection experiment which shows that electrons have both
particle properties and wave properties. De Broglie present the idea of particle wave duality
through the momentum conversion basis of electron deflection experiment

There are different examples regarding a single particle which is trapped inside different potential distributions in one-dimensional, two-dimensional or threedimensional cases. In each case we will discuss the example by applying Schrodinger’s equation and coming to conclusions about the motion of the particle and probabilities of finding the particle. Also, we simulate results from the Schrodinger’s equation with MATLAB software package using different numerical techniques and inbuilt libraries to plot resulting functions.
