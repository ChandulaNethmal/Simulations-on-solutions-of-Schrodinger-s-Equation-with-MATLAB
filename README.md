# Simulations-on-solutions-of-Schrodinger-s-Equation-with-MATLAB

Since some behaviors of electromagnetic waves and atomic particles could not be understood within the scope of classical laws of physics, scientists started to do researches and experiments to build up a revised formulation which can explain reasons to this indeterministic behavior. Specially the wave-particle duality of electrons came up as results of several scientific experiments such as electron deflection experiment which shows that electrons have both particle properties and wave properties. De Broglie present the idea of particle wave duality through the momentum conversion basis of electron deflection experiment.
Before that Max Plank was already presented the idea of energy quanta based on the contradiction between experimental results and the classical theory of light which they used to explain the photoelectric effect. As a next giant step on quantum mechanics, in 1926 an Australian physicist Erwin Schrodinger came up with a formulation which is called the wave mechanics incorporated with the principles of quanta and the wave particle duality which we discussed above.  Here we are discussing the motion of a single particle inside a crystal by the wave theory with the basis of the wave-particle duality. 
There are different examples regarding a single particle which is trapped inside different potential distributions in one-dimensional, two-dimensional or threedimensional cases. In each case we will discuss the example by applying Schrodinger’s equation and coming to conclusions about the motion of the particle and probabilities of finding the particle. Also, we simulate results from the Schrodinger’s equation with MATLAB software package using different numerical techniques and inbuilt libraries to plot resulting functions.
